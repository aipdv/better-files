## What it does

- Meaning search for documents and photos. The search index and the model stay on your phone.
- No account.
- Analytics are off until you turn them on. See the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).
- File manager: root access, archives, SMB, SFTP, FTP and WebDAV, themes.
- Needs Android 10 or later.

## Install

Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aipdv/better-files/releases).

The search model (EmbeddingGemma 2, about 320 MB) downloads once, after you accept the Gemma terms. Photo search needs one more download of about 110 MB.

## Known limits

This is a beta.

- The first index takes hours on older phones. You can search files as soon as they are done, newest first.
- Some phones stop apps in the background. On vivo, turn on Settings > Battery > High background power consumption for Better Files. On Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme, allow Autostart and turn off battery limits for the app.
- If indexing stops, open Better Files. It continues where it stopped.
- Phones with less than about 3.5 GB of RAM search inside documents by keyword only. Meaning search and photo search need more memory.
- Scanned PDFs and password-protected PDFs are not searchable yet.
- Excel, PowerPoint and old .doc files are not indexed yet.

## Build

Install Android NDK 26.3.11579264 before building.

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

Release builds read the signing key from `signing.properties` (see `signing.properties.example`) or from `STORE_FILE`, `STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD`. A build without `POSTHOG_API_KEY` and `POSTHOG_HOST` has no analytics.

## Based on Material Files

Better Files is based on [Material Files](https://github.com/zhanghai/MaterialFiles) by Hai Zhang.
