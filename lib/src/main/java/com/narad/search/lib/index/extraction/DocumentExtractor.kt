/**
 * Extracts plain text from document files.
 *
 * Split design for host-JVM testability:
 *
 * 1. [extractStream] - runs on host JVM (only android.util.Log, stubbed in tests). Dispatches
 *    by MIME type:
 *    - "application/pdf" -> PdfBox-Android text extraction (Apache-2.0)
 *    - "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" (DOCX) ->
 *      ZipInputStream + SAX over word/document.xml. No Apache POI in the production classpath.
 *    - "text/plain", "text/markdown" -> raw InputStream.readText
 *    - anything else (including null) -> returns null (no exception thrown)
 *
 * 2. [extract] - Android wrapper (Android imports allowed). Resolves a
 *    android.net.Uri to an InputStream + MIME type via ContentResolver,
 *    then delegates to [extractStream]. This path is NEEDS-DEVICE and is not
 *    exercised in the host gate tests.
 *
 * Security (KTD6, M6):
 * - Actual inflated bytes are counted as they are read; ZipEntry.size is never consulted.
 *   Entries that expand past [maxDocxBytes] are refused (zip-bomb guard).
 * - word/document.xml is refused if it contains a null byte (UTF-16/32 encoding) OR if its
 *   ISO-8859-1 view contains "<!DOCTYPE". This catches both UTF-8 and UTF-16/32 DOCTYPE
 *   injections. See [containsDoctype].
 * - The SAX parser has external-general-entities and external-parameter-entities disabled as
 *   defence-in-depth. The byte pre-check is the portable authoritative guard because Android's
 *   SAX factory (libcore) does not support "disallow-doctype-decl".
 * - Entries before word/document.xml are drained through a counted reader (not closeEntry),
 *   capped at a separate 100 MB skip budget, so a junk entry cannot inflate unbounded.
 *
 * Bug Watch addressed:
 * - PdfBox-Android: org.bouncycastle excluded in lib/build.gradle.kts (F1).
 *   Encrypted PDFs may throw Error subclasses (NoClassDefFoundError); caught via Throwable.
 * - Encrypted DOCX: the file is an OLE container, not a standard ZIP. ZipInputStream finds
 *   no word/document.xml entry and returns null. No POI dependency needed for this path.
 * - Image URIs are NOT handled here; image files are indexed via the embedding pipeline (F1).
 *
 * M18 event wiring: [onWarn] is called alongside each existing Log.w failure. The caller
 * (IndexWorker) injects a closure that writes the event to [IndexRepository.appendEvent].
 * Messages passed to [onWarn] are short static strings and exception class names only;
 * they never contain extracted file content (KTD18).
 *
 * @param maxDocxBytes Maximum inflated bytes read from word/document.xml. Entries that
 *   expand past this limit are refused. Default is 10 MB (ample for realistic office docs).
 *   Inject a smaller value in tests to keep fixtures small and fast.
 * @param maxDocxEntries Maximum number of ZIP entries visited before aborting. A ZIP with
 *   millions of empty entries can tie up the worker without inflating many bytes; this limit
 *   stops iteration early. Default is 10_000 (real DOCX files have tens to a few hundred
 *   entries). Inject a smaller value in tests.
 * @param onWarn Called alongside each Log.w failure. Receives the exception class name (or a
 *   short token) and a brief static message. Never contains file content. Null = no-op.
